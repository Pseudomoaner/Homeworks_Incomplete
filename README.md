# Homeworks_Incomplete
 Public, unworked versions of homework sheets created by me.
 
 Consists of two folders at present:
  1.  ODE_Modelling: Exercise on numerical simulation of metabolic ODE models, largely based on the model of [Piccardi et al](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15979.short)
  2.  PHY119_BrownianSimulations: Exercise drawing empirical links between microscopic-scale diffusion (Brownian motion) and its predictable large-scale properties. Formed part of the course [PHY119: Frontiers of Physics](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.504451!/file/PHY119.pdf), taught by Mack Durham.
