    "\n",
    "Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are widely used in theoretical biology to model systems with dynamic populations. One of the most well-known systems is the __[Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)__, which model the population dynamics of a collection of prey (represented by the variable $x$) and predator (represented by $y$) animals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha x - \\beta xy,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\delta xy - \\gamma y.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these may look somewhat daunting to the uninitiated, they actually have quite a simple interpretation:\n",
    " -  The differentials on the left-hand-side ($\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}$) indicate the instantaneous rate of change of the two populations. Positive values indicate that the population is growing, while negative values indicate that it is shrinking.\n",
    " -  The term $\\alpha x$ represents the ability of the prey population to reproduce. The parameter $\\alpha$ sets the rate of self-replication.\n",
    " -  The terms $-\\beta xy$ and $\\delta xy$ represent the predation process. For a predation event to occur, a preditor must encounter a prey animal - this encounter rate is dependant on both the size of the predator population and the prey population, resulting in the product $xy$ in these terms. The parameter $\\beta$ sets the overall scale of the predation rate, while $\\delta$ also encodes the efficiency with which the preditor population is able to convert prey biomass into new predator individuals.\n",
    " -  The term $-\\gamma y$ represents the death of predators. The parameter $\\gamma$ sets this death rate.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another way of looking at this is to say that *the rate of change in a population is equal to the rate of inflows minus the rate of outflows*. So-called 'stock and flow' diagrams can be used to help us conceptualise the key processes to include when assembling such a model:\n",

    "## ODEs in microbiome research\n",
    "\n",
    "Given their ease of use and intuitive structure, ODEs are also widely used in microbiome research. As well as abstract ecological models such as the Lotka-Volterra model, systems known as **consumer-resource models** (aka resource-explicit models) are also widely used. These explicitly simulate both the size of the microbial populations and the chemicals with which they interact, allowing such processes as nutrient consumption and waste production to be directly investigated. This contrasts with the Lotka-Volterra system, where the resources (e.g. the amount of vegetation available to the prey population) are abstracted out of the model. The dynamics of the two types of system can be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet, we will aim to replicate the model of __[Piccardi et al. (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15979.full.pdf)__, which simulates the population dynamics of a toxin-degrading community. To help us, it will be useful to look at couple of additional mathematical tricks commonly used in this field.\n",

    "### Typical terms in microbiome ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summation terms\n",
    "\n",
    "In microbiomes containing many different species, explicitly writing out all the interactions between them can become cumbersome. Instead, we usually assume that all the interactions in the system can be characterised by a single functional form, with interactions between different pairs of species being represented by different parameters in this function. The impact of all interactions on a single species can then be calculated by simply summing together all of the interactions acting on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the *generalised Lotka-Volterra equation* can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = r_i + \\sum^N_{j=1} A_{i,j} x_{j},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i$ is the population size of species $i$, $r_i$ is the intrinsic growth rate of $i$, and $A_{i,j}$ denotes the strength and sign of the interaction between species $i$ and $j$ (positive implying enhancement of growth of $i$, negative implying reduction of growth). The summation term $\\sum^N_{j=1}$ is shorthand for $A_{i,1} x_1 + A_{i,2} x_2 + ... + A_{i,N} x_N$, representing the combined influence of the other species in the system on the growth of $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Monod equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Monod equation* is a classical representation of the ability of cells to utilize nutrients. It is generally used to allow us to take into account the empirical observation that cell growth rate is a saturating function of nutrient availability. We define it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nu = \\nu_{max} \\frac{[N]}{[N] + K_N},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu$ is the growth rate, $\\nu_{max}$ is the maximal possible growth rate, $[N]$ is the nutrient concentration and $K_N$ is the so-called 'half-velocity constant', the concentration $[N]$ at which $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}\\nu_{max}$. This may be familiar as being identical in form to the Michaelis-Menton equation, which provides similar saturating kinetics for enzymatic reactions.

As you should have seen in exercices 2 and 3, nutrients and toxins are generally rapidly depleated, meaning the system equilibrates quite rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative setup is the __[chemotstat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemostat)__, where fresh media is continuously added to the system and waste continuously removed. It is relatively simple to incorporate this into the equations for this sytem, merely requiring that fresh nutrients and toxins at $N_0$ and $T_0$ are added at a rate $D$ and that cells are removed at the same rate.\n",

    "#### Cross-detoxification model\n",
    "\n",
    "The facilitation of species 1 by species 2 observed so far occurs in spite of the fact that both are identical. As we saw in exercise 4, under low toxin regimes, this facilitation turns to competition due to the perfect niche overlap of the two populations.\n",

    "More stable mutualisms between species can occur if both species target different components of a toxic mixture; in such cases, the growth of the first species depends on the continued presence of the second species, and *vice versa*.

    "A related question is whether the dynamics of the community in the original single-toxin model can be substantially altered by mixing species with different properties. For example, does mixing one species with a high fractional investment in toxin detoxification $f_i$ with one with a low fractional investment result in a different outcome to mixing two species with identical middling investments?\n",

    "If you have a more mathematical background, you may be interested in taking a more analytical approach to understanding these ODEs. While simulations can give us a general overview of the possible outcomes of models, analysis can give us a deeper understanding of how and why these outcomes occur. For example, you might ask:\n",

(Hint: Setting $\\frac{d[S_i]}{dt} = 0$ and solving the resulting equation will provide you with an isocline in nutrient/toxin space)\n",
    "- Are there stationary points in the nutrient/toxin space? Does the system tend to evolve towards these points, or away from them? Are they stable or unstable?\n",
